# Tic-Tac-Toe-Min-Max-Algorithm
# Project Description:
A fully functioning C++ Program to find the next best move in Tic Tac Toe game using Min Max Algorithm.

#Algorithm:
In Min-max the two players are called maximizer and minimizer. The maximizer tries to get the highest score possible while the minimizer tries to do the opposite and get the lowest score possible.
  1.	Maximizer goes LEFT: It is now the minimizers turn. 
  Minimizer now has a choice between 3 and 5. Being the minimizer it will definitely choose the least among both, that is 3.
  2.	Maximizer goes RIGHT: It is now the minimizers turn. 
  Minimizer now has a choice between 2 and 9. It will choose 2 as it is the least among the two values.
